My second project in the Coding Academy by Orange:
It was required to use Figma to create a wireframe and mockup for a website.

Details :
The site is called Little Princesses, which sells fashions for little girls.
 It contains 4 pages:
1) Home: It contains the trendiest and best-selling fashions and a catalog of types of clothing.
2) Registration: It contains a form that allows customers to register on the site.
3) Login: It contains a form that allows customers to enter the site through their account.
4) Catalog: It contains all the services provided by the site, and the buy icon.
